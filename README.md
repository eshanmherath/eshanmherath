My name is Mewantha. I am an Artificial Intelligence Researcher who is currently focusing on Autonomous Vehicle Design and Psychological aspects of potential General Artificial Agents. Currently I am contributing as Chief Scientist to a USA based Artificial Intelligence Startup. My professional journey was interesting, where I went through many, yet related, disciplines; including Mathematics, Electronics, Telecommunication, Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Currently AV Design and Cognitive Robotics.
